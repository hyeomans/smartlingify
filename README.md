## Smartlingify

### Description
Smartling is a platform that facilitates all translation of your app/website resources. It's great what is not great is
their integration with VCS.
You can think of Smartling as your resources repository but that is disconnected from your source code repository and
this is where this tool can help you.

This standalone app will create a local copy of your project resources and compare them to you local source code repository.
After a local copy is made, this tool will allow you to:

* Submit those resources files that haven't been submitted to smartling
* Download latest translations and compare changes, once those changes are good, it will submit those to smartling.
